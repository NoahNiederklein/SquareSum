# Square Sum Problem

main.py: Code to compute the number of permutations of 1..n such that the sum of every pair of consecutive numbers is a perfect square.

square_path_{n}.txt contains all square-sum permutations for that value of n. Note that for larger n the files can become large (square_path_40.txt is only 12 MB but contains 439936 rows).

Note that it can take quite some time for the results to be computed. The provided execution times are illustrative of general time complexity trends and should not be interpreted as precise benchmarks for any particular hardware or environment.
